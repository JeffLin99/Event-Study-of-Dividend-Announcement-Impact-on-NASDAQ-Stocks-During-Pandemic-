# Event-Study-of-Dividend-Announcement-Impact-on-NASDAQ-Stocks-During-Pandemic-
In early 2020, the global society faced the outbreak of a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. The rapid spread of the virus led the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Committee to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the end of January 2020 (World Health Organization 2020). The cautious response to COVID-19 infections had cascading effects on various aspects of society, particularly the economy (Hossain 2020). To mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic, each affected country was engaged in developing appropriate pandemic policies tailored to its own circumstances. However, the adverse economic consequences for countries remained unavoidable (Ibn-Mohammed et al., 2020).

Economic slowdown coupled with policies such as large-scale social restrictions led to scenarios like layoffs and financial difficulties, affecting not only individuals but also stock investors. This situation could potentially impact the volatility of capital markets during the corresponding period. Khanal and Mishra (2017) studied the stock price movements around dividend announcements during the period of low economic growth from 2006 to 2012 and found substantial increases in stock prices during such announcements. Abreu and Gulamhussen (2013) investigated the case of U.S. bank holding companies during the period around the 2007-2009 financial crisis and observed differing reactions to expected growth in dividend payments. Before the financial crisis, the reaction to expected growth wasn't significant, but during the crisis, the reaction became positive. These results suggest that the effectiveness of the dividend signaling theory might significantly increase during economic downturns.

Therefore, examining the impact of COVID-19 on stock market volatility compared to pre-outbreak conditions can provide valuable insights for future academic research. This study focuses on the NASDAQ index and its component stocks, exploring and researching the following two questions:

Question 1: How did the abnormal returns of listed companies in the NASDAQ, within Â±5 days of cash dividend announcement, compare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Question 2: What differences are observed in the market's reaction to dividend announcements before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?
