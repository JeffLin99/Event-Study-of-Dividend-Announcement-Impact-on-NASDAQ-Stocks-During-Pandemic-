# Event-Study-of-Dividend-Announcement-Impact-on-NASDAQ-Stocks-During-Pandemic-
**Intro**
In early 2020, the global society faced the outbreak of a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. The rapid spread of the virus led the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Committee to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the end of January 2020 (World Health Organization 2020). The cautious response to COVID-19 infections had cascading effects on various aspects of society, particularly the economy (Hossain 2020). To mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic, each affected country was engaged in developing appropriate pandemic policies tailored to its own circumstances. However, the adverse economic consequences for countries remained unavoidable (Ibn-Mohammed et al., 2020).

Economic slowdown coupled with policies such as large-scale social restrictions led to scenarios like layoffs and financial difficulties, affecting not only individuals but also stock investors. This situation could potentially impact the volatility of capital markets during the corresponding period. Khanal and Mishra (2017) studied the stock price movements around dividend announcements during the period of low economic growth from 2006 to 2012 and found substantial increases in stock prices during such announcements. Abreu and Gulamhussen (2013) investigated the case of U.S. bank holding companies during the period around the 2007-2009 financial crisis and observed differing reactions to expected growth in dividend payments. Before the financial crisis, the reaction to expected growth wasn't significant, but during the crisis, the reaction became positive. These results suggest that the effectiveness of the dividend signaling theory might significantly increase during economic downturns.

Therefore, examining the impact of COVID-19 on stock market volatility compared to pre-outbreak conditions can provide valuable insights for future academic research. This study focuses on the NASDAQ index and its component stocks, exploring and researching the following two questions:

Question 1: How did the abnormal returns of listed companies in the NASDAQ, within Â±5 days of cash dividend announcement, compare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Question 2: What differences are observed in the market's reaction to dividend announcements before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?


**Conclusion on the Results:**

In summary, this study aims to explore the effects of dividend announcements on the returns of NASDAQ index component stocks during the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that the average cumulative abnormal returns for events of dividend increase or no change in both years before and during the pandemic show similar trends. Notably, there is a significant rebound after the events, suggesting that investing in such favorable events during the pandemic can yield abnormal returns, especially due to the overall rebound of the US stock market. The abnormal returns during the pandemic in 2020 are generally higher than those before the pandemic in 2019. On the contrary, for events of dividend decrease, a completely opposite phenomenon occurs. The average cumulative abnormal returns in 2020 exhibit a larger decrease compared to 2019, indicating that the market becomes more sensitive to negative information during the pandemic.

However, considering the results of various hypothesis tests from the previous section, it can be concluded that before the pandemic, abnormal returns were significant around dividend announcements in 2019, both before and after the events. Investors could obtain abnormal returns by buying or selling before or on the day of the dividend announcement, aligning with the dividend signaling theory. Analyzing event types reveals that dividend increase announcements are the primary source of abnormal returns. During the pandemic, abnormal returns mainly occur before the events, also based on positive signals of dividend increase. However, there are no significant abnormal returns after the events, indicating a weak market response to these favorable events during the pandemic.

Furthermore, through further conformity tests, it is found that for negative events (dividend decrease), abnormal returns persist for consecutive days during the event window in the pandemic period, mainly showing negative values. This pattern was absent before the pandemic, reflecting a pessimistic and unfavorable market attitude towards such negative information. In short, focusing on these three event types, the study suggests that the market before the pandemic responded significantly only to swiftly favorable events, while during the pandemic, it exhibited a notable response mainly to negative events, ultimately generating abnormal returns.

Certainly, this study has limitations and gaps. For instance, it only examines final dividends, neglecting the potential impact of interim dividends. Additionally, it considers only the variable of dividend announcements on mean and variance of stock prices, disregarding other variables that might be present in reality. The study also uses data from 2020 as the pandemic period, while in reality, the pandemic spanned at least two years. Future research projects could address and enhance these aspects.
